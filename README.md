## Project - Gaming PC Build in a Sun Ultra 24 Case
### Why?
I really like the style of these case which date back to around 2007. They have great airflow through the giant front grille and are ATX compatible which makes for a relatively build.

### Sourcing a near-20 year old case
I was able to purchase my 'bare' case from [Clyde Computers](https://clydecomputers.co.uk/search?q=ultra+24). It arrived in great condition...

Note that as a 'bare' case it's missing the front I/O panel. More on that later. Inside, the case was empty but did retain a hard drive cage.

### Readying the interior

Removing this cage did require me to drill out a number of rivets. This took a while but once I found the right HSS drillbit it was pretty straightforward. Note the use of masking tape to avoid scratching the paint during the process.

### The build
I started by fitting some fans. After some measuring I went with:
- Noctua NF-A14x25 G2 PWM - 140mm intake for the front of the case
- Noctua NF-A9 PWM - 92mm intake, also for the front of the case
- Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 PWM - 120mm exhaust for the rear, along with...
- Corsair HXi Series HX1000i - power supply and other exhaust
